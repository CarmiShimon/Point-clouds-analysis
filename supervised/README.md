# Point Clouds Analysis
Algorithmic methods for finding anomalies in point clouds
We wish to find anomalies in a noisy background in the humans search and rescue field, using unsupervised classifiers.
Assuming the scanned scene is large and contains many points we split our data into smaller windows, depends on the objects of interest's dimensions.
